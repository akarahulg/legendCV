    abstract = {The Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) aboard AstroSat has good sensitivity to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with close to 600 detections including about 50 discoveries undetected by other missions. However, CZTI was not designed to be a GRB monitor and lacks localization capabilities. We introduce a new method of localizing GRBs using ‘shadows’ cast on the CZTI detector plane due to absorption and scattering by satellite components and instruments. Comparing the observed distribution of counts on the detector plane with simulated distributions with the AstroSat Mass Model, we can localize GRBs in the sky. Our localization uncertainty is defined by a two-component model, with a narrow Gaussian component that has close to 50  per cent probability of containing the source, and the remaining spread over a broader Gaussian component with an 11.3 times higher σ. The width (σ) of the Gaussian components scales inversely with source counts. We test this model by applying the method to GRBs with known positions and find good agreement between the model and observations. This new ability expands the utility of CZTI in the study of GRBs and other rapid high-energy transients.},

              Solar flares are regularly observed in extreme-ultraviolet soft X-rays (SXRs) and hard X-rays (HXRs). However, those in near- and mid-ultraviolet are sparse. The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board the Aditya-L1, launched on 2023 September 2, provides regular observations in the 200–400 nm wavelength range through 11 filters. Here, we report the observation of the X6.3 flare on 2024 February 22 using eight narrowband (NB) filters of SUIT. We have also used co-spatiotemporal observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA), Solar Orbiter/STIX, GONG H
              α
              , Aditya-L1/SoLEXS, and GOES. We obtained light curves over the flaring region from AIA 1600 and 1700 Å and GONG H
              α
              and compared them with the disk-integrated light curve obtained from GOES and SoLEXS SXRs and STIX HXRs. We find that the flare peaks in SUIT NB01, NB03, NB04, and NB08 filters simultaneously with HXRs 1600 and 1700 Å, along with the peak temperature obtained from SoLEXS. In contrast, in NB02 and NB05, the flare peaks ∼2 min later than the HXR peak, while in NB06 and NB07, the flare peaks ∼3 min after the GOES SXR peak. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of a flare in these wavelengths (except in NB03, NB04, and NB05). Moreover, for the first time, we show the presence of a bright kernel in NB02. These results demonstrate the capabilities of SUIT observations in flare studies.},

	abstract = {The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument on the Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched on 2 September 2023. SUIT continuously provides near-simultaneous full-disk and region-of-interest images of the Sun, slicing through the photosphere and chromosphere and covering a field of view up to 1.5 solar radii. For this purpose, SUIT uses 11 filters tuned at different wavelengths in the 200 – 400 nm range, including the Mg ii h and k and Ca ii H spectral lines. The observations made by SUIT help us understand the magnetic coupling of the lower and middle solar atmosphere. In addition, for the first time, this allows for the measurements of spatially resolved solar broad-band radiation in the near- and mid-ultraviolet, which will help constrain the variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance in a wavelength range that is central for the chemistry of ozone and oxygen the Earth’s stratosphere. This paper discusses the details of the instrument and data products.},

              We present the multiwavelength study of the ejection of a plasma blob from the limb flare {SOL}2023-12-31T21:36:00 from {NOAA} 13536 observed by the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope ({SUIT}) on board Aditya-L1. We use {SUIT} observations along with those from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly ({AIA}) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays ({STIX}) on board Solar Orbiter to infer the kinematics and thermal nature of the ejected blob and its connection to the associated flare. The observations show that the flare was comprised of two eruptions. The blob was ejected during the first eruption and later accelerated to velocities over 1500 km s
              −1
              measured at a maximum projected height of ∼178 Mm from the Sun’s surface. The acceleration of the ejected plasma blob is cotemporal with the bursty appearance of the hard X-ray light curve recorded by {STIX}. Radio spectrogram observations from {STEREO}-A/{WAVES} and {RSTN} reveal type {III} bursts at the same time, indicative of magnetic reconnection. {DEM} analysis using {AIA} observations suggests the plasma blob is comprised of cooler and denser plasma in comparison to the ambient corona. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of such a plasma blob in the near-ultraviolet providing crucial measurements for eruption thermodynamics.},
