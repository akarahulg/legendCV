\cvdescpara{Developed an exact numerical solver for Euler's equations and studied standard hydrodynamic problems such as the SOD shock tube and Sedov-blast problems by creating simulation codes. Applied these hydrodynamic techniques to model a toy supernova case, analyzing variations in physical properties.}
